Hello hello! So you decided to dive into this wonderful world known as Linux? 

Incredible! 

Linux(or as it's more properly called GNU/Linux) is a family of operating systems used in all types of computers--from laptops to web servers to refrigerators to the virtual computer you see to the right of this text.  Linux is free software: free to use, free to hack on, and free to make your own.  It comes from a rich history of free, fully authorable software.

This lineage can make Linux an empowering, creatively powerful experience.  You will interact with computers in a uniquely personal way, making them your own and having them do exactly as you'd like.  This lineage also means there's a tremendous amount of diversity in what Linux means, how it looks, and what it's intended for.  

This diversity and creativity is incredible, but can make also make getting started feel overwhelming.  There's a whole host of new names, often referring to the same thing with subtle distinctions, and all these creative, open-ended ways to work with the system.  The Linux journey is not a straight path. It's not even a path at all.  It's a sprawling open field teeming with unique wildlife and distinct flora, all inviting and imposing at once.

The set of scenarios you find here are intended to help you take the first step into this field, and give some names to the plants and bugs you find here.  All exercises can be done using the virtual computer you see on your right (don't worry about using it yet, just take a gander).  At the end of the journey, we'll offer some advice on how to install Linux on your own computer, and which distribution in the family of Linux distributions might be right for you.

As with any journey to a new place, it can be good to know its history and some of the local names.  So Let's learn a bit of both now!
